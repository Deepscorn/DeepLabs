# DeepLabs
toolkit for Unity 5 (work in progress)

Right now it is just a small set of utils that came in handy in my yet small experience being a Unity developer. All of it can and certanly will change. But this may be a starting point to collaborate. You may freely use that lib and it's code as long as you reference author. And, please, see Dependencies directory - there are thrid-party libraries, which I will maintain that project because I am just successfully using it here and there :)


In the future I will split it up to some directions. It may be 
- AI, 
- geometry, 
- some addons to existing AI navigation frameworks, 
- dynamic level generating and pool control, 
- UI screens for both android & ios with built-in testing functionality, 
- native methods helper, 
- in-memory & database caching, 
- language addons (enum string annotation-provided converter), 
- unity class addons, constants, generic singletons, means to easily create objects with common setup, 
- logging, 
- network processing, 
- basic UI elements familuar to android devs - AlertDialog, Toast,
- image download and caching,
- unity world debug drawing (gizmo) helpers
